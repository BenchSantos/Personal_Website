        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            As a second-year BSIT student at TUP-Manila, I am a dedicated and self-motivated individual with a passion for technology. I excel in following instructions and am known for being responsible, hardworking, and mature. As a team worker, I am adaptable and thrive in challenging situations. I am equally comfortable working independently and collaborating with others to achieve shared goals. Additionally, I am experienced in working under pressure and meeting strict deadlines, which has prepared me well for any workplace environment
